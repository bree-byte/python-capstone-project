# Project Description
# Problem:
Fans often struggle to find information about concerts, cultural events, or shows by their favorite artists or event organizers. Ticketing platforms may not list all events, and official social media posts can be scattered, making it hard for fans to discover events in one place and fans can easily miss on events
# Solution:
My project provides a centralized platform where artists and event organizers can post their events, including details like location, date, and ticket links. Events are categorized by tribe or cultural group which will make it easier for fans to search and find relevant events quickly.
# Tools Used
. Python – for building the core functionality and data handling.
. JSON – for storing event data in a structured format.
# Insights & Benefits
. Artists and event organizers can reach fans more effectively by posting events in one central place.
. Fans save time by viewing all upcoming events in one location rather than checking multiple social media accounts or websites.
. Event organizers can track the number of events posted and ensure no event is missed.
. For businesses or communities, this can help promote cultural events, improve attendance, and support local entertainment industries.
# “Aha!” Moment:
Seeing all events stored in one file, organized by tribe, made it immediately clear how much easier it is for a fan to discover events they care about, without scrolling endlessly on social media. And it's even more interesting because it doesn't have to be tribes only,even artists can post about their events
# Deployment Options
Once the Python project is complete, I'll deploy using

Lovable – because it Quickly turns Python scripts into simple web apps for fan interaction and doesn't involve alot of coding for me at the moment. I will consider using streamlit in future.
